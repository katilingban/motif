## Africa CDC Colours

The Africa CDC employs three corporate colours: Green, Gold and Black.

```{r acdc-primary, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 1}
structure(acdc_palettes$acdc_primary, class = "palette", name = "Africa CDC Primary Colours")
```

These are complemented by a set of five secondary colours.

```{r acdc-secondary, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 1}
structure(acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary, class = "palette", name = "Africa CDC Secondary Colours")
```

### Africa CDC light theme

```{r mtcars-acdc-light-bar, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5}

ggplot(
  data = mtcars,
  mapping = aes(
  x = factor(vs, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("v-shaped", "straight")),
  fill = factor(cyl))
) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Cylinders", values = acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary) +
  labs(
    title = "Light ACDC Theme",
    subtitle = "Using the Africa CDC secondary palette",
    x = "Engine Shape", y = "Counts"
  ) +
  theme_acdc_light()
```

```{r mtcars-acdc-light-scatter, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 6, fig.width = 5}
