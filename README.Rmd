A collection of palettes, themes, and theme components based on publicly available branding guidelines of various non-governmental organisations, government agencies, and United Nations units.

## What does `motif` do?

`motif` provides or will be providing utilities for applying the various visual identity and/or branding guidlines of various non-governmental organisations, government agencies, and United Nations units.

Currently, `motif` has colours, palettes, and `ggplot2` themes based on the [Africa CDC](https://africacdc.org/) [visual identity guidelines](https://africacdc.org/download/visual-identity-africa-cdc-branding-guide/).

Additional colours, palettes, and themes will be provided over time.

## Installation

`motif` is not yet available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) but can be installed through the [Katilingban R universe](https://katilingban.r-universe.dev) resository as follows:

```R
install.packages(
  "motif", 
  repos = c(
    'https://katilingban.r-universe.dev', 
    'https://cloud.r-project.org'
  )
)
```

## Usage

### Africa CDC colours and palettes

```{r acdc-primary, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 1}
structure(acdc_palettes$acdc_primary, class = "palette", name = "Africa CDC Primary Colours")
```

```{r acdc-secondary, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 1}
structure(acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary, class = "palette", name = "Africa CDC Secondary Colours")
```

### Africa CDC `ggplot2` theme

```{r mtcars-bar-acdc, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.height = 6, out.width = "50%"}
## theme_acdc_light
ggplot(
  data = mtcars,
  mapping = aes(
  x = factor(vs, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("v-shaped", "straight")),
  fill = factor(cyl))
) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Cylinders", values = acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary) +
  labs(
    title = "Light ACDC Theme",
    subtitle = "Using the Africa CDC secondary palette",
    x = "Engine Shape", y = "Counts"
  ) +
  theme_acdc_light()

## theme_acdc_dark
ggplot(
  data = mtcars,
  mapping = aes(
  x = factor(vs, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("v-shaped", "straight")),
  fill = factor(cyl))
) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Cylinders", values = acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary) +
  labs(
    title = "Dark ACDC Theme",
    subtitle = "Using the Africa CDC secondary palette",
    x = "Engine Shape", y = "Counts"
  ) +
  theme_acdc_dark()
```


```{r mtcars-scatter-acdc, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.height = 6, out.width = "50%"}
## theme_acdc_light
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = disp, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_colour_manual(
    name = "Cylinders", 
    values = acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary
  ) +
  labs(title = "mpg by disp grouped by cyl") +
  theme_acdc_light()

## theme_acdc_dark
ggplot(data = mtcars, mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = disp, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_colour_manual(
    name = "Cylinders", 
    values = acdc_palettes$acdc_secondary
  ) +
  labs(title = "mpg by disp grouped by cyl") +
  theme_acdc_dark()
```
